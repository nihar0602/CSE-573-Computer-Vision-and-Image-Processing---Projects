The training part of our code requires the installation of openmpi 
In ubuntu you can do this by:

sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
pip3 install mpi4py

To run training after installing above dependencies, please use the following syntax
python3 FaceDetection.py 0 1

Also, you will need the "Model_files" for loading train images to train the model.
